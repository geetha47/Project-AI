This project explored AI methodologies to investigate the ways to detect 
fungus from the images of wood utilizing deep learning algorithms, specifically CNN 
combined with a pre-trained model for accurate prediction. These methods resulted in high 
accuracy up to 99% and accurate prediction of the samples at hand. Furthermore, this project 
also succeeded in integrating the AI model into a mobile device with the help of TensorFlow 
API and Android Studio. 

#Next steps: With these results, the app is ready to be used and shared with the 
operators working with wood after getting validated by the RISE research institute and 
approved for deployment in the field.
